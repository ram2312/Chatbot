**WORKING**

The python script implements a BERT-based question-answering model trained on a human resources (HR) dataset. The model is fine-tuned on a pre-trained BERT model using the transformers library.The code starts by installing the transformers library and importing the required libraries, including torch, transformers, and DataLoader. Then it defines a list of HR-related questions and answers.Next, it reads the HR-specific dataset from a file and processes it to create two lists of questions and answers.After that, it defines the HRDataset class to represent the HR dataset and the HRModel class to define the BERT-based HR model. The HRDataset class takes questions, answers, and a tokenizer as input and preprocesses the data by encoding it into input_ids, token_type_ids, and attention_mask tensors. The HRModel class loads a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tunes it on the HR dataset.
The script defines a train_hr_model() function that takes questions, answers, and a tokenizer as input and trains the HR model using the HRDataset and DataLoader classes.The script then defines a SaveModel() function that fine-tunes the pre-trained BERT model on the HR dataset and saves the fine-tuned model and tokenizer. Finally, it defines a LoadModel() function that loads the fine-tuned BERT model and tokenizer and returns them.
If there is any question which isnâ€™t present in dataset, the model searches for similar questions and answers, then returns the output which has the highest cosine similarities, considering it is suitable to the question.
