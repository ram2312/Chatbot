**DESIGN OF CHATBOT**
Load the HR-specific dataset into memory using Python’s file I/O library: This step involves reading the HR-specific dataset, which contains HR-related questions and answers, from a text file and storing it in memory using Python’s file input/output (I/O) library.
Tokenize the questions and answers using the BERT tokenizer: Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into smaller units, called tokens. In this step, the BERT tokenizer is used to tokenize the questions and answers in the HR-specific dataset.
Define a PyTorch dataset that returns the tokenized input and output sequences: A PyTorch dataset is an abstraction that represents a collection of data samples. In this step, a PyTorch dataset is defined that takes in the tokenized questions and answers and returns them in a format that can be used to train a deep-learning model.Define a PyTorch model that uses the BERT model to encode the input sequence and a linear layer to output the binary classification result: In this step, a PyTorch model is defined that takes in the tokenized questions as input and uses the pre-trained BERT model to encode them. The output of the BERT model is then passed through a linear layer that outputs a binary classification result (1 or 0) indicating if the answer is relevant to the input question.
Train the model using the HR-specific dataset: The defined model is trained on the HR-specific dataset using backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to opti
mize the model parameters. The training process involves iterating over the dataset multiple times (epochs) and updating the model weights after each iteration.
Fine-tune the trained model on the pre-trained BERT model: The pre-trained BERT model is further fine-tuned using the trained model from step 5 to improve its performance on the HR-specific dataset.
Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use: Once the fine-tuning is complete, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer are saved to disk for future use.
Define a function to load the saved model and tokenizer: A function is defined that can load the saved model and tokenizer from the disk into memory.
Use the loaded model and tokenizer to generate responses to HR-related queries: Finally, the loaded model and tokenizer are used to generate responses to HR-related queries by encoding the input question using the BERT model and using the linear layer to classify the relevance of the answer. The answer with the highest relevance score is returned as the response to the query.
